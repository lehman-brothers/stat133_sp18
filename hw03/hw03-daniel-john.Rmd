## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Windows Note
## Please note: I am using a Windows computer, as such I am not able to insert the Bash code chunk as described in the requirements for this Homework. Professor Sanchez posted a workaround solution for Windows users where we write code but it will not be evaluated. Please refer to the announcement made by him on March 12. Thank you.
