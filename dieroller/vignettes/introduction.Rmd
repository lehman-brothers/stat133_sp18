# Dieroller Package
## the package dieroller is a mimimal implementation for simulating rolling a six sided die a specified number of times. Summary statistics and a visualization of the die rolls are also provided in the output. 

# Creating a Die
## the first step in this package is to create a die, using the function die()

sample_die <- die()
sample_die

## by default this will create a fair six sided die with a 1/6 probability of landing on each side. These specifications can be changed with changing the arguments "side" and "prob"

weird_die <- die(sides = c('i', 'ii', 'iii', 'iv', 'v', 'vi'))
loaded_die <- die(prob = c(0.075, 0.1, 0.125, 0.15, 0.20, 0.35))

# Rolling the Die
## the next step is to specify the die you want to roll and how many times you wish to roll it. Example below shows a user rolling the "loaded_die" example shown above 500 times: 

loaded_roll_500 <- roll(loaded_die, times = 500)

# Summary Roll Info
## the summary.roll function will provide summary statistics for the user specified die roll. The following example illustrates use of the function: 

set.seed(123)
fair_50rolls <- roll(fair_die, times = 50)
fair_50sum <- summary(fair_50rolls)

fair_50sum

## what's in the summary
class(fair_50sum)
names(fair_50sum)
fair_50sum$freqs

# Plot Roll Summary
## The plot roll function will create a barplot based on the summary statistics above. Below is an example of the use: 

plot_roll(fair_50)

# Other Methods Functions
## These additional functions include ways to extract, replace, and add different values related to the rolls. Examples are as follows: 

## extracting roll in position 500
fair500[500]

## replacing last roll
fair500[500] <- 1
fair500[500]
summary(fair500)

## adding 100 rolls
fair600 <- fair500 + 100
summary(fair600)
```
